## Overview

Intelligent-fronthaul-network-optimization is a powerful developer tool designed to analyze, visualize, and optimize fronthaul network performance through data-driven insights. It combines topology inference, traffic analysis, and capacity estimation to support network reliability and scalability.

**Why intelligent-fronthaul-network-optimization?**

This project helps network engineers understand complex fronthaul structures and traffic dynamics. The core features include:

- 🌿 🔍 **Topology Inference:** Automatically deduces cell-to-link relationships using correlation and clustering techniques.
- 📊 📈 **Traffic Visualization:** Generates detailed plots of link traffic patterns over time, highlighting bottlenecks.
- 🔧 **Capacity Estimation:** Calculates minimum link capacities considering buffers and peak loads for robust planning.
- 🌐 **Data Aggregation:** Converts cell-level data into comprehensive link-level insights for performance monitoring.
- 📱 **Interactive Dashboard:** Provides an accessible interface for exploring network topology and capacity metrics.
